# Resilience Hydrology System

Physics-based water harvesting using natural atmospheric gradients.

## The Problem
During drought, conventional irrigation fails. Wells go dry, rivers stop flowing, 
water becomes scarce. People and crops suffer.

## This Approach
Instead of pumping or transporting water, we amplify the natural process of dew 
formation using temperature, pH, and light gradients that exist everywhere.

Output: 0.034-0.14 mm/day depending on conditions and energy available.

## How It Works
( read repo files )

## Status
Working prototypes in testing. Code is functional. Hardware is proven.

This is OPEN SOURCE research. Use it, modify it, share it.

## Quick Start
- **Researchers**: See /theory for equations and models
- **Builders**: See /hardware for schematics and BOM
- **Coders**: See /firmware for ESP32/Arduino code
- **Users**: See [drought-survival-builds repo] for complete build guides
