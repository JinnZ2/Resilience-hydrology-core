## What I built
[PHOTO]

## Why
I live in a trailer and needed drinking water without infrastructure.

## Parts
- 2× DS18B20 temp sensors ($10)
- ESP32 dev board ($8)  
- Peltier cooler ($15)
- 18650 battery + solar ($12)
- Collection container (had it)

Total: $45

## Results (7 days, Nov 2025, northern MN)
- Night 1: 85ml
- Night 2: 110ml
- [data...]
Average: 95ml/night

## Code
See /resilience-hydrology-core/firmware/esp32/trailer-basic/

## Failures
- Condensation froze on night 4 (need insulation)
- Battery died day 6 (need bigger panel)

## Next iteration
- Add heater for frost protection
- Double solar panel size
