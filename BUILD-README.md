# Drought Survival Builds

Practical, buildable water harvesting systems for drought conditions.

## I Need Water Right Now

Start here:
1. **Budget < $50**: [Build #01 - Basic Dew Collector]
2. **Budget < $200**: [Build #02 - Basic Field Node]  
3. **Budget < $2000**: [Build #03 - Complete Field System]
4. **I'm a farmer**: [Build #04 - Farm-Scale Deployment]

## What These Do
These systems don't create rain. They amplify natural condensation (dew/fog) 
that would happen anyway.

Typical output: 50-500ml per night depending on system size and climate.

## Build Difficulty
- ⭐ = Hand tools, no electronics knowledge
- ⭐⭐ = Basic soldering, can follow tutorials
- ⭐⭐⭐ = Comfortable with Arduino/code
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ = Can design and debug systems

## Climate Zones
Each build includes seeds optimized for:
- Arid (hot deserts)
- Semi-arid (dry grasslands)
- Mediterranean (dry summers)
- Tropical dry (monsoon climate)

## Start Building
Pick your build, get the parts, follow the guide.

Post your results (success or failure) so others can learn.

## Safety
This amplifies natural processes. It's not weather modification.
It's not dangerous. But don't be stupid.
